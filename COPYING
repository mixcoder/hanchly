-- CC-CEDICT: http://cc-cedict.org/wiki/

CC-CEDICT is a continuation of the CEDICT project. The objective of the CEDICT
project was to create an online, downloadable (as opposed to searchable-only)
public-domain Chinese-English dictionary. CEDICT was started by Paul Andrew
Denisowski in October 1997. For the most part, the project is modeled on Jim
Breen's highly successful EDICT (Japanese-English dictionary) project and is
intended to be a collaborative effort, with users providing entries and
corrections to the main file.
